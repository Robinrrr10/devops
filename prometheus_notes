Prometheus
---------
---------


Prometheus is the open source free tool which will collect metrics from any server or any vm or k8 or docker etc
It will collect almost all metrics. Eg: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network, and many more etc

It will work on pull based meaning. Meaning. Prometheus will call an api of server to get the metrics.
We have different agent(Eg: node exporter, app exporter, sql exporter etc...and more) for prometheus which will expose an api in the server. That agent will be installed in server where we wanted to collect the metrics.
That agent will create the api. Prometheus server will call the api to collect the metrics.


Set of premetheus server or prometheus installation: (in cent os )
---------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Update yum using below command
sudo yum update -y

Step 2: Download premetheus from official page ( https://prometheus.io/download/ ). I copied the link and used below command to download
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.35.0/prometheus-2.35.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 3: Extract the tar using below command
tar -xzvf prometheus-2.35.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 4: Rename the extracted folder to prometheus-files using below command
mv prometheus-2.35.0.linux-amd64 prometheus-files
 
Step 5: Create the prometheus user using below command
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus

Step 6: Create directories of /etc/prometheus and /var/lib/prometheus and given permission
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus

Step 7: Copy prometheus-files/prometheus and prometheus-files/promtool to /use/local/bin/ and give permission
sudo cp prometheus-files/prometheus /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp prometheus-files/promtool /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool
 
Step 8: Copy prometheus-files/consoles and prometheus-files/console_libraries to /etc/prometheu and give permission
sudo cp -r prometheus-files/consoles /etc/prometheus
sudo cp -r prometheus-files/console_libraries /etc/prometheus
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_libraries

Step 9: create /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file using below command and give content and permission
sudo vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

Copy below content in file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and save it

global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']


Give below command to give permission
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

Step 10: Create service using below command and give the content and save it
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

Copy below content and paste and save it
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Step 11: Give below command to reload daemon and start prometheus
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start prometheus

Step 12: Give below command to check status of prometheus. It should show active.
sudo systemctl status prometheus

Step 13: Open port 9090 and reload firewall using below  command
firewall-cmd --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Step 14: Now open browser and give below ip address of prometheus installed server along with port like below
http://ipaddress:9090/graph
Eg: 
http://192.168.18.131:9090/graph

Step 15:
It should show prometheus page in browser. Thats it



Setup of client server (server which we need to monitor) or prometheous node exporter : (in cent os ) 
---------------------------------------------------
Node exporter will give collect metrics of server, VM or any machine.
It will collect almost all metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, network, disk and many more

Step 1: Download node exporter from https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter using below command  //Node exporter is to monitor server machine
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.3.1/node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 2: Extract downloaded tar file using below command
tar -xzvf node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 3: Go inside extracted folder using below command
cd node_exporter-1.3.1.linux-amd64

Step 4: Run node_exported using below command
./node_exporter

Step 5: Open port 9100 and restart firewalld
firewall-cmd --add-port=9100/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Step 6: Check below link is giving metrics or not
http://ipaddressofclientmachine:9100/metrics

Eg
http://localhost:9100/metrics



Set up prometheus server to collect metrics from other client services (In prometheus server)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: open /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file
vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

Step 2: Give ip address of client in -target   Eg:- targets: ['192.168.18.130:9100']
Example:
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['192.168.18.130:9100']
      
Step 3: Restart prometheus using below command
systemctl status prometheus

Step 4: Now verify on browser whether prometheus server is collecting metrics from client server or not
Give http://192.168.18.131:9090/graph in browser
Give any metrics name in search box and check whether it is giving metrics or not
Thats it



Note:
Prometheus server time and its all client machine time should have same time
http://localhost:9100/metrics will give metrics detail in api response. It will contain type of metrics and help which describe the metrics



MySQL Exporter: Setup of mysql server 
-------------------------------------
This is used to collect metrics related to mysql database.

Below step needs to be done in machine where mysql database is running.

Step 1:
Go to below link
https://prometheus.io/download/

Step 2:
Copy the link address to download the mysqld_exporter tar file and download in mysql machine
Eg:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter/releases/download/v0.14.0/mysqld_exporter-0.14.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 3:
Extract the tar file
Eg:
tar -xzvf mysqld_exporter-0.14.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 4:
Create a file in below path. We should only use below path. Then only it will work
 vi /root/.my.cnf
 
Add below content with mysql user and password and save it
[client]
user=root
password=Admin@123


Step 5: 
Open port 9104 and restart the firewall
Eg:
firewall-cmd --add-port=9104/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Step 6:
Go to extrator mysql exported and run the mysql exported
Eg:
./mysqld_exporter

Step 7:
Now call below link and check whether it is working not not. It should show metrics in response
http://192.168.18.129:9104/metrics

Step 8:
If need we can run this on background when starting the server.
Eg:
nohup /home/mysql/mysqld_exporter-0.14.0.linux-amd64/mysqld_exporter &> /home/mysql/mysqld_exporter-0.14.0.linux-amd64/nohup.out &
We can add above line in ~/.bash_profile to start automatically in background







Prometheus functioning:
----------
Prometheus will call the api of its exporter and store the metrics
Prometheus will store retrived data into its time series database
Prometheus will create http service which will accept the query and give result

Prometheus metrics type:
----------------------
4 types
counters:
Record the value which will increase everytime

Gauges:
Record the value which can increase or decrease

Histograms:
It will be used later point for calculation like average, percentage etc in give range or custom range

Summary
It will be used later point for calculation like average, percentage etc



Prometheus UI:
---------------
URL:
http://localhost:9090

Prometheus UI will be running on above port

In main graph page, it will takes the query
It has option to check query history, local time and auto complete
We can add our query in expression and execute 
And then we can see in table or graph format

If need we can add multiple pannel and then we can execute multiple query expression

Alert option in UI:
Alert will show inactive, pending and firing alerts

Status -> Runtime and Build information:
This will give information about the prometheus, its start time, directory and its version and more

Status -> TSTB status:
This will show databases data.
We can check databases status here
We can also take query from here and paste in expression and execute and see the table or graph

Status -> Command line flag:
Here we can see few command which we can use to change the config

Status -> configuration:
This will show prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yaml)

Status -> Rules :

Status -> Targets:
Here we show all targeted client servers here along with status

Status -> Service discovery
It will give few informal like prometheus running address and port, metrics endpoint, etc
