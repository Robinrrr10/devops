After running any operating system if we face any issue related to display resolution or any thing related to that VM system use below steps to resolve it

Run the VM
Devices -> Insert guest additions CM image  //CD image of of gues additions will be get the file system
Open my computer or the file system
We can see VirtualBox guest additions where we usually see the CD image
Open VirtualBox guest addition folder
Double click VBoxWindowsAdditions and install    //If it is linux or other operating system follow the same step with command or other tool to install
Once installed, restart the machine
Now check whether the resolution or the VM system issue has been resolved or not


Note:
  Usually this needs to install once installation is done on the virtual box. So that it works without any issue
